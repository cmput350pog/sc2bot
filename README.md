Group members
- Ahzam Ahmad

- Thomas Chan

Project groups consisting of 4 (or 3) students who will work together on a video game AI project. This year we will concentrate on StarCraft 2 AI. All projects will create a full-game StarCraft 2 bot based on the C++ game API Blizzard provides (rather than Python or Command-Center (a modular C++ SC2 bot). At the end of the course we will use the CactusValleyLE map to run a tournament between all StarCrat 2 bots. A fraction of the project marks will depend on how well bots do in the tournament.
